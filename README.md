# Nicholas Tamburri's Game Design Project

This is my project for MSCS565 Game Design and Programming I, Fall 2018. It is
an implementation of a classic bubble-shooting game in Python using Pygame.

Run `game.py` to begin.

here. The requisite file names are:

* music/
  * bgm1.wav
  * bgm2.wav
  * game_clear.wav
